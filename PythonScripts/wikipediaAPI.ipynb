      "Page - Summary: Bee and PuppyCat is an American adult animated streaming television series created and written by Natasha Allegri. The series revolves around Bee (voiced by Allyn Rachel), an unemployed woman in her early twenties, who encounters a mysterious creature named PuppyCat (voiced by the Vocaloid program Oliver). She adopts this apparent cat-dog hybrid, and together they go on a series of temporary jobs to pay off her monthly rent. These bizarre jobs take the duo across strange worlds out in space. The original series was produced by Frederator Studios with the animation initially outsourced to South Korean studio Dong Woo Animation.\n",
      "The series originated with a web pilot in 2013, followed by a Kickstarter supported first season which was released on YouTube from 2014–16. \n",
      "A re-adapted series entitled Bee and PuppyCat: Lazy in Space was produced and billed for a 2019 release on VRV, but was delayed and leaked online in 2020. \n",
      "Netflix later commissioned three additional episodes, also re-adapting the pilot episodes, and then packaged these along with the Lazy in Space episodes. The complete rebooted series was released on Netflix in 2022. KaBoom! Studios also published a comic book adaptation from 2014–16.\n",
      "On January 4, 2023, Genius Brands announced that they would sell a 50% stake in the series to Toho International, the US-based division of Japanese film studio Toho\n"

A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a <b>pizzaiolo</b>.\n",

      "</p><p>The term <i>pizza</i> was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania. Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries. It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe, North America and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza),  restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, via pizza delivery, and as street food. Various food companies sell ready-baked pizzas, which may be frozen, in grocery stores, to be reheated in a home oven.\n",
