# Python Dudas and/or Preguntas

- How do you print range between two numbers?
    -print(range(1, 101))
- How do you know to import the whole module or just part of it?
  - e.g. ` import datetime` vs. `from datetime import datetime`
    - If I do the first one, `datetime.now()` fails, but with the second one it succeeds.
